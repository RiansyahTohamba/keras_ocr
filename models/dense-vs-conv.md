## what is the opposition of fully connected layer?

A fully connected layer, also known as a dense layer, is a type of neural network layer in which every neuron in the layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. The opposite of a fully connected layer is a convolutional layer, which is a type of layer commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

A convolutional layer applies a set of filters (or kernels) to the input, where each filter is moved across the input in a process called convolution. The filters extract features from the input, such as edges or patterns, and the output of the convolutional layer is a feature map. In contrast to fully connected layers, convolutional layers have a smaller number of parameters and are more efficient in processing images, videos, and grid-like structured data.

Convolutional layers are designed to maintain the spatial structure of the input data and reduce the number of parameters by using the same filter for multiple parts of the image or video. This allows the network to learn features from a small part of the input, and then reuse them at different positions.

Another layer that can be considered as the opposite of fully connected is the recurrent layer, which is a type of layer commonly used in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) . RNNs are designed to process sequential data, such as text, speech, or time series data. The recurrent layer allows the network to maintain information from previous time steps, which is important for tasks such as language modeling or speech recognition.
